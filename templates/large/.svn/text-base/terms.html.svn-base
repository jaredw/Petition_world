<b>Show Your Vote Terms of Service</b><br>
<br>
Show Your Vote (the "Service") allows individuals and organizations to submit a vote in support for the COP15 Copenhagen Climate Summit, to add additional content and comments through social networking tools, and to explore the content submitted by other users.  Votes from individuals and organizations will be aggregated to produce statistics at the city, state/territory, country and regional levels, and will be presented at the COP15 Copenhagen Climate Summit in order to portray the level of public support for the activities of the COP15.  This information will be presented by Google in conjunction with the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and participating climate change campaigns.<br>
<br>
Show Your Vote is a web element that can be embedded on any website.  Since Show Your Vote interacts with a variety of services, many services may receive information about you through your use of the Service. To understand how your information submitted through Show Your Vote will be displayed and used, you should review these Terms of Service.  You should also review the terms of service and privacy policy of the website where the Show Your Vote element is displayed to understand that site's policies.<br>
<br>
By using the Service, you agree to be bound by the <a href="http://www.google.com/accounts/TOS" target="_blank">Google Terms of Service</a>, the <a href="http://www.google.com/privacypolicy.html" target="_blank">Google Privacy Policy</a>, and the additional terms and conditions set forth below.  These documents, taken together, form an agreement between you and Google (referred to as "the Agreement" below).<br>
<br>
<b>Submissions</b><br>
<br>
When you submit your vote, we ask for several required fields of information (such as city and state/province) to help us organize and present aggregated vote information, and provide you the opportunity to submit additional information, such as comments (together the "User Submissions."). If you submit your vote as an individual, your information will be aggregated with other voters' information, for example to display that one hundred other individuals from your town support the COP15 initiative.  You may also choose to use Google's Friend Connect service when you submit your vote, and if so, your user profile information may be displayed on the Show Your Vote explore map.  Votes submitted from organizations will also be aggregated, and an icon will be displayed on the map at the physical location you provide for the organization.  Google will share aggregated information with the website that hosts the Show Your Vote web element.  For example, we may share with the host website that one hundred individuals submitted a vote in support of the COP15 from their website.<br>  
<br>
Because the Service focuses on collecting user content on topics regarding climate change and the COP15, there are certain types of content that are not suitable for submission, and will not be accepted in the Service, as described below.<br>
<br>
By submitting User Submissions to the Service, you give Google a perpetual, irrevocable, worldwide, royalty-free, and non-exclusive license to reproduce, publicly display and otherwise use the User Submissions. You confirm that you have the right to provide the User Submission.  For example, if you submit as an organization, you confirm that you have the authority to submit information on behalf of such organization.<br>  
<br>
<b>Appropriate Conduct and Prohibited Actions</b><br>
<br>
You agree that you are responsible for your own conduct and content while using the Service, and are responsible for any consequences thereof. You agree to use the Service only for purposes that are legal and in accordance with this Agreement. By way of example, and not as a limitation, you agree that when using the Service, you will not:<br>
<br>
(a) defame, abuse, harass, stalk, threaten or otherwise violate the legal rights (such as rights of privacy and publicity) of others;<br>
(b) upload, post, email, transmit or otherwise make available the name, address, phone number or email address of any individual, where that information was not made publicly available by that individual;<br>

(e) upload, post, email or transmit or otherwise make available "spam", including messages that promote pyramid schemes, chain letters or disruptive commercial messages or advertisements, or anything else prohibited by law, these Terms of Service or any applicable policies or guidelines;<br>
<br>
